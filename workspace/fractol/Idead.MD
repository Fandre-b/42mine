In fractal visualization, colors are typically used to represent the number of iterations it takes for a point to escape to infinity under the fractal-generating function. This is often called the "escape time" algorithm.

The simplest way to color a fractal is to choose two colors and create a gradient between them, with one color representing a point that escapes quickly and the other color representing a point that escapes slowly. The color of each point on the fractal is then determined by its escape time.

However, there are many ways to enhance this basic coloring method to produce more visually interesting images:

- **Multiple gradients**: Instead of just transitioning between two colors, you can transition between multiple colors. For example, you could transition from red to green for points that escape quickly, and then from green to blue for points that escape slowly.

- **Color cycling**: Instead of mapping the escape time directly to a color, you can use the escape time as an index into a color palette, and cycle through the palette multiple times. This can create a "banding" effect that highlights the structure of the fractal.

- **Smooth coloring**: Instead of using the raw escape time to determine the color, you can use a smooth function of the escape time. This can eliminate the "banding" effect and create a smoother gradient of colors.

- **Histogram coloring**: Instead of mapping the escape time directly to a color, you can create a histogram of escape times, and use the histogram counts to determine the colors. This can ensure that all colors are used equally, and can highlight subtle features of the fractal.

The specific coloring method used can vary widely depending on the specific fractal being generated and the aesthetic choices of the programmer.

zoom will change the range (double) 

maybe run zoom in small inbetween steps

periodicity checking - if z value return to arroud an known z value we can say that its trapped within the boundry

Yes, there are data structures that are designed to efficiently handle intervals or ranges of values, such as Interval Trees and Segment Trees. These are particularly useful in computational geometry and similar fields where you often need to work with ranges of values.

An Interval Tree is a type of binary search tree where each node stores an interval (or range of values), and you can query the tree to find all intervals that overlap with a given interval. This can be useful for quickly finding all z values that are within a certain range, for example.

A Segment Tree is another type of binary tree used for storing intervals, or segments. It allows for faster querying (retrieval) of these intervals for a certain point or another interval.

Use compiler optimizations: Most compilers have options to optimize your code. For example, in GCC, you can use the -O2 or -O3 option to enable various performance optimizations.
